# Embedded code

During my first encounter with the Wemos D1 I was able to connect the LM35 Temperature sensor so i can read out the current temperature. To Achieve this i needed to read the raw analog voltage from the sensor. Next the raw voltage had to be converted to millivolts so that a represantable temperature value could be calculated.
