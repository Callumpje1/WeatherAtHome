During the first week of the Minor i had some issues with coming to all the classes due to work. I wasn't able to do as much as i had wanted to do and this meant i got a below average for my very first performance review, not a good start. In the upcoming weeks i have sorted the situation with work and am going to make sure to do get back up to speed on the minor. 

I have been able to spend more time on the project during week 2. On monday i was able to setup my issues board on Git to get my user stories sorted. This way i am also able to make a more specific project planning for the upcoming weeks, which will help me a lot. On this day i was also able to setup the Chart.js library which i will be using to show historic weather data to the user. I had some issues with connecting the LCD display, I will one of my fellow students if they can help me with this issue the very next workday.

On Wednesday i had a bad night sleep due to my son waking up very early. Because of this i didn't spend my time very efficiently. I created the SQL database in workbench and I spent a lot of time figuring out how to get a button connected to the Wemos D1 mini. Unfortunately I still have not got it to work like i would want it to. I will ask one of my fellow students if they can help me figure out the issue i am having.
