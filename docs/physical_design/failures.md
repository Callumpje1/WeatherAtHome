# Failures

During my first encounter with the laser cutting machine i ran into some issues whit the design i had chosen. The design i wanted to use was way too detailed and didn't create the type of casing that would be able to hold the embedded device. In my next iteration i will decrease the amount of detail in the design. However i have learned more about working with the laser cutter which means i will need less time next time working with the machine. And i had also got some experience working with Inkscape and Laserwork which i would use when creating my next iterations.

After some time trying to figure out the detailed design for Grogu i decided to leave the design and think up a new product to case my embedded device. After some thinking i came up with the idea to create a miniature canal house.
When creating the first iteration of my new design i had an idea on how to create the roof for my house. However this design had some flaws and didn't work out the way i had imagined it. The roof didn't fit onto the design correctly and didn't contain roof panels to close the design. This part was essential because i wanted to add a LED module behind the window, this wouldn't work if the roof was open. When i was creating the paper prototype i didn't plan to put the led inside the roof, at first i just wanted it inside the house. However when i created the prototype on the laser cutter i realised that it would look a lot nicer if the components were spread out. This meant the house had to be redesigned to fix the issues.

After fixing the intital issues of my design it was time to upload the file to the laser cutter and get working. When the laser cutter was finished it looked like the new design had worked. The roof now contained the right slots to hold the roofpanels and all components were spaced out correctly. However when trying to put the prototype together i realised that the house didn't fit together correctly, there was too much space inbetween the slots meaning they didn't fit together correctly. After doing some research i realised the laser cutter has an amount of material that it cuts away when creating a design, this is called Kerf. To make the pieces fit together snug i needed to take the right amounnt of Kerf into account. In my next two iterations i tested different amounts of Kerf-width to figure out how much i needed to apply. After the second minitature iteration i had found out the laser cutter had a kerf of 0,15mm. When adding this amount to the width of my borders the pieces should fit together perfectly.
